# ðŸ§ª js-sandbox

This repository is my personal JavaScript playground â€” a place for experimenting, building, and learning through small projects, coding challenges, and syntax practice.

It includes:
- Snippets and functions across core JavaScript concepts
- DOM manipulation practice
- ES6+ features

ðŸ“š **Primary learning resources**: 
- [CodÃ©dex's JavaScript Path](https://www.codedex.io/intermediate-javascript)
- [CodÃ©dex's React Path](https://www.codedex.io/react)
- [MDN JavaScript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

This repo evolves as I explore new ideas or revisit old ones with a deeper understanding. It serves both as a revision base and a testing ground.
